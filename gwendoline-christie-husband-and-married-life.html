Most famously, Christie, who stands 6 feet 3 inches tall, as the tall warrior Brienne of Tarth in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones.</strong></p><p>When the actress landed the role of Larissa Weems in Tim Burton’s critically acclaimed Netflix series Wednesday, her fame took off even more.</p><h2><span id=Does_Gwendoline_Christie_Have_a_Spouse_Her_Quiet_Romance>Does Gwendoline Christie Have a Spouse? Her Quiet Romance</span></h2><p>In contrast to her career pursuits, the actress has maintained a notoriously low profile when it comes to her romantic life. People are curious about Christie’s dating status in 2023 even though she has a propensity to keep things quiet.</p><p>Particularly since Gwendoline starred in a few critically renowned TV shows like Wednesday and Game of Thrones, many people have been curious as to whether the 44-year-old actress is married.</p><p>Yes, that is not the case! Gwendoline is single right now and hasn’t disclosed anything about her spouse. So, in 2023, who is Christie dating? In the next headings, we’ll discuss her partner and boyfriend.</p><h2><span id=Giles_Deacon_Gwendoline_Christie8217s_longtime_partner_is_now_her_partner>Giles Deacon, Gwendoline Christie’s longtime partner, is now her partner.</span></h2><p>Christie has not yet tied the knot with anyone, but she and her lover Giles Deacon have been enjoying a blissful relationship as of late. They are both well-known individuals in the entertainment sector.</p><p>Although Gwendoline is an actor, her partner Deacon has established a strong reputation for himself in the fashion industry with elaborate, dramatic, and culturally-inspired creations. The well-known British creative director and fashion designer has even created pieces for his partner throughout the years.</p><h2><span id=Christie_with_Giles_her_partner>Christie with Giles, her partner.</span></h2><p>Furthermore, Giles Deacon’s girlfriend of about ten years also gave her beau’s amazing designs a lot of praise. She once chose a silk gown that Deacon had made, printed with British Isles bird eggs.</p><p>The Hollywood celebrity went on to say that her longtime partner was her favorite designer later on. About her boo, she sent an email to Telegraph saying,</p><p>“One of my favorite designers for a very long time is Giles. He possesses two qualities that I find most admirable in artists: a creative mind and meticulous technique.</p><p>Even though [his designs] are sculptural, mind-bending, ethereal, and useful, wearing them always makes you feel like a celebrated woman. In some way, their confidence boosts yours. It is quite the ability for a designer to possess. His outfits have individualities.</p><h2><span id=Christie8217s_boyfriend_Deacon_and_her_were_first_friends>Christie’s boyfriend Deacon and her were first friends.</span></h2><p>Their friendship preceded their feelings for one another, as it does in many partnerships. In an early 2013 interview with Stylist, Gwendoline was the one to first disclose that they were initially pals. Christie answered the interviewer’s question on how involved and communicative she is with her fans on social media by saying,</p><p>“I’ve stopped using social media.” It’s not really healthy, in my opinion. It’s better not to know. Furthermore, it is utterly self-indulgent.</p><p>But the star of Game of Thrones stated She tweeted about a piece from her friend Giles Deacon’s jewelry line “yesterday” to the television network QVC.</p><p>Gwendoline added in the same interview that her best buddy is Henry Holland, a fellow London-based fashion designer. Speaking of her two friends, she stated,</p><p>“That those people are my pals is a great blessing. I’m fortunate to have them all as wonderful individuals. They work tremendously hard in an extremely challenging sector and are brilliantly talented and intelligent. Almost all of my buddies are artists.</p><h2><span id=Deacon_Christie8217s_partner_was_smitten_with_her>Deacon, Christie’s partner, was smitten with her.</span></h2><p>According to some accounts, the two initially crossed paths in 2012. For the designer Giles Deacon, it was love at first sight when they first met. With her, he fell “instantly smitten” in love. In 2018, he told Yahoo! News.</p><p>“I was instantly smitten when I met Gwendoline six years ago through a mutual friend.”</p><p>He continued,</p><p>I felt she was exceptional for a million different reasons. I had never seen anything like the way she carried herself before.</p><p>The seasoned designer has since collaborated on other projects as a professional team alongside his partner. It is a “absolute joy to work with professionally, and we’ve dressed her for many occasions, most recently the Emmys,” he once said in an interview with Britain’s Grazia magazine.</p><p>Deacon continued, saying that his long-term partner “knows more about film and fashion than I do, and she has her own unique sense of self.” Having that to play with is fantastic.</p><h2><span id=Star_of_Game_of_Thrones_Gwendoline_Started_Dating_Giles_on_New_Year8217s_Eve_in_2012>Star of Game of Thrones Gwendoline Started Dating Giles on New Year’s Eve in 2012</span></h2><p>As previously said, Christie, an actress for television and movies, has kept details about her romantic life rather private. Giles, her longtime partner, shares her views regarding their personal lives.</p><p>Thus, at first, the couple kept their developing romance a secret. They did, however, appear together on a number of occasions at the period.</p><h2><span id=Gwendoline_Christie8217s_longtime_partner_Deacon_and_her_lover_Gwendoline>Gwendoline Christie’s longtime partner Deacon and her lover Gwendoline.</span></h2><p>However, later on, we learned that Christie and her boyfriend, Deacon, have been together since 2012’s New Year’s Eve. They had already gone on a number of dates before then, including one to the Elle Style Awards. There, the couple accompanied Deacon’s design collaborators, Jonathan Saunders and Henry Holland.</p><p>Since then, they have enjoyed a happy relationship.</p><h2><span id=Are_Deacon_And_Gwendoline_Wed>Are Deacon And Gwendoline Wed?</span></h2><p>They aren’t married to go on dates. Despite dating since the early 2010s, neither the actress nor her partner, the fashion designer, have discussed their future wedding plans.</p><p>It appears that we won’t be witnessing them become husband and wife anytime soon.</p><h2><span id=Her_Position_on_Wednesday>Her Position on Wednesday</span></h2><p>Gwendoline Christie began starring in Wednesday, the supernatural comedic horror series, in 2022. In the series, she portrayed Larissa Weems, the principal of Nevermore Academy. In addition, Riki Lindhome, Jenna Ortega, Emma Myers, Iman Marson, and several others are in the cast.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Aeko Catori Brown, Jordana Lajoie, and Cogeian Sky Embry."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":67}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/aeko-catori-brown/"}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jordana-lajoie/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cogeian-sky-embry/"}{"1":67}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Lavinia Valbonesi Biografia Wikipedia | Daniel Noboa Wife And Kids</a></h3>Barbara Edmonds is a prominent politician from New Zealand who is affiliated with the Labour Party.
