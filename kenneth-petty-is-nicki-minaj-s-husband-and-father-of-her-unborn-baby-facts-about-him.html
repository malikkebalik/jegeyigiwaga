She didn’t share any information about the ceremony, though.</p><p class=dh>Instead, she just uploaded a short video of two coffee mugs – one had “Mrs.” and the other had “Mr.” written on the outside – and two hats – one said “Bride,” and the other one “Groom.”</p><p class=dh>For the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B357b7xHN_0/>caption</a>, Minaj wrote the date of the ceremony – October 21, 2019 – and her real name with her husband’s last name at the end – Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty.</p><p class=dh>Following her wedding, she told rapper <a class="me a" href=#>Lil Wayne</a> on his show “Young Money Radio” that she couldn’t complain about her married life and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/pregnant-nicki-minajs-husband-kenneth-petty-5-things-to-know/he-goes-by-a-nickname/>even labeled Petty</a> as her “soulmate.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>NICKI MINAJ’S PREGNANCY</strong></p><p class=dh>Several months went by, and nothing out of the ordinary seemed to be going on in their relationship as she kept posting photos and videos of them, just like she had been doing since late 2018.</p><p class=dh>On July 20, 2020, <a class="me a" href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> announced on Instagram that she was expecting her first child.

There was also a sort of halo around her that attracted a lot of attention.</p><p class=dh>The due date of Nicki Minaj and her husband’s baby is still unclear, but judging by her social media posts and the recurrent displays of affection shown by the couple, that child will grow up in a house filled with love.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>KENNETH PETTY’S CRIMINAL HISTORY</strong></p><p class=dh>Kenneth Petty’s life has not been flawless, though. In 1995, when he was a teenager, he was convicted of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8533743/who-did-nicki-minaj-marry-kenneth-petty>attempted rape</a>.

The incident took place in 2002, and Lamont Robinson passed away as a result of gunfire.</p><p class=dh>Minaj’s husband was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but according to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/nicki-minaj-new-boyfriend-kenneth-zoo-petty-everything-to-know/>People</a>, he only served seven years behind bars as he was on a supervised release program between 2013 and 2018.</p><p class=dh>In March this year, Petty made headlines again. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9330776/kenneth-petty-facing-federal-charges-register-sex-offender>Billboard</a> reported that he was facing federal charges for failing to register as a sex offender even though the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office dropped the charges.</p><p class=dh>Kenneth Petty was taken into custody, pleaded not guilty on March 4, and was released on a $100,000 bond.
