If that’s true, it would seem the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome did it properly.</p><p>When a Metrodome-record 54,088 patrons strolled through the venue’s doors for the final regular season game ever on Oct. 6, 2009, they had no idea what was to come. The <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Twins</a> felt fortunate to be there after chasing down the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tigers</a> and erasing a seven-game deficit in the American League Central over the final 26 games with an 18-8 stretch. Meanwhile, the Tigers needed a final day gem from Justin Verlander in Chicago to stay tied with the Twins after going 11-15 down the stretch.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>But if you thought the pennant race was interesting, Game 163 managed to top it all with twists, turns, amazing plays, gaffes, heroism and controversy. As we approach the 10-year anniversary of that game, The Athletic Detroit and The Athletic Minnesota spoke to 23 players, coaches and staff members who were on hand to witness a chaotic game that lasted 277 minutes and spanned 12 innings. Here’s their story of how it all went down.</p><h3><strong>The buildup</strong></h3><p><strong>Ramon Santiago, Tigers second baseman:</strong> We had a lead the whole year, pretty much. We lost some ground later in the season. Anything can happen in baseball when you face an MLB team every single day. Like we said in baseball, “They drive Mercedes, too.”</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Miguel Cabrera</a>, Tigers first baseman:</strong> I remember, in September, they were really hot. When we played (in Detroit late in the month) and we split the four games two-and-two, I remember I said, “No, we got this because there’s no way they can catch up in our division.” And they got it on the last day.</p><p><strong>Steve Liddle, Twins bench coach:</strong> We had been scoreboard watching Game 162, because the Tigers had a tough time beating the (<a class=ath_autolink href=#>White Sox</a>). The (White Sox) had been struggling, but it’s just one of those teams that the Tigers had trouble with. … All the fans stayed around in the Metrodome. I remember after the game, everybody going out and high-fiving fans. “We got more life. We got more life.”</p><p><strong>Jesse Crain, Twins relief pitcher:</strong> The stadium was full. We’re sitting there watching (Tigers-White Sox on the field). And you never pulled for Chicago as much ever before, but it was so exciting. I’ll never forget that weekend.</p><p><strong>Ron Gardenhire, Twins manager:</strong> When it was all over with, there was a nice little party celebration and players running around high-fiving the fans and it was cool. It was one of those kind of surreal things that you’re like, “Wow, did that just really happen?”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Liddle:</strong> That was our second year in a row with Game 163. They say every game doesn’t matter — every game does matter, I’m sorry. You might not be able to win the pennant in April, but you can lose it. It was important — every game is important throughout the year, and sometimes you think, during a marathon, you might lose one game to win the next four or five. But you gotta be careful doing that, because Game 163.</p><h3>Pregame</h3><p>In the era before <a class=ath_autolink href=#>MLB</a>’s Wild Card Game, the tie atop the AL Central set up a tiebreaker game with a spot in the playoffs on the line — the loser would be out. There was a slot on the schedule for a potential tiebreaker game to take place on Oct. 5, 2009. But the Twins shared the Metrodome with the Minnesota Vikings, who were scheduled to play on Monday Night Football that night, pitting Brett Favre against his old Packers team. So Game 163 was moved to Oct. 6. Winner would get the 103-win <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Yankees</a> the next day in New York.</p><p><strong>Joe Vavra, Twins hitting coach:</strong> It was a bunch of nobodies … We had Matt Tolbert, we had (Jose) Morales, we had guys you never would have heard of. Alexi Casilla. We had a lot of utility guys playing that game.</p><p><strong>Jim Leyland, Tigers manager:</strong> There weren’t really any secrets, as far as what the Minnesota Twins had and what we had. We knew each other pretty well, obviously. You just go about your business like you always do. Everybody knows it’s a one-and-done game, so there’s not really any rah-rah stuff or pumping up.</p><p><strong>Matt Guerrier, Twins reliever:</strong> With the Vikings against Green Bay on Monday night, we couldn’t play that night at the dome. So we all went to that game and we’re like, “Wow.” The electricity in the dome during that football game was crazy.</p><p><strong>Curtis Granderson, Tigers center fielder:</strong> We got in I think on Sunday, and we were going to play Monday but then they moved us to Tuesday so we went out to eat. This is the first and only time this has ever happened. We’re eating, we order, whatever, and the server goes, “Hey, our manager brought this. This is compliments of the manager.” And it was a full bottle of Grey Goose. I was like, “Hey, that time that we can’t enjoy it, now you’re going to give it to us?!” I remember we laughed when it happened, and everyone was like, “What should we do? We should take it.” But they had already opened it and everything. I was going to ask for a to-go bag and bring it for later.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Nick Punto, Twins second baseman:</strong> Brett Favre, yup. We not only had the season end on a Sunday, and that was intense as it was. We had to wait another full 24 hours until we got to have Game 163 underway. So it started out intense and finished intense.</p><h3><b>First inning</b></h3><p><i>The game began at 4:08 p.m. The Twins started 28-year-old right-hander Scott Baker, who would finish the season 15-9 with a 4.37 ERA. In the top of the first, Baker retired the side, getting Curtis Granderson to fly out, striking out Placido Polanco and inducing a Magglio Ordonez flyout to right field.&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>Rick Anderson, Twins pitching coach:</b> You look at the kids, the young pitchers, and you just don’t know how they’re gonna react. (Baker) just attacked, did what he did, didn’t try to do nothing more.</p><p><b>Dustin Morse, Twins senior manager, player relations:</b> I remember KFAN radio, Paul Allen kind of coined the term “Big Spot Scott.” It seemed like Baker had all the big games in 2009. When he was on the mound you felt like he was in control. He was a pretty calm person. He just didn’t have a lot of highs and lows with him. But he was quietly getting it done.</p><p><b>Punto: </b>The thing with Scott Baker, he’s perfect for those scenarios. I think his heart rate doesn’t ever get too high and it doesn’t get too low. He’s just one of those demeanors where there’s not going to be a moment too big and he’s going to embrace it and he’s got great stuff to do it.</p><p><i>The Tigers started a 20-year-old Rick Porcello, a former first-round pick who went 14-9 with a 3.96 ERA in his rookie season. Denard Span grounded out to begin the inning. After an Orlando Cabrera groundout, Joe Mauer hit a ball to center and hustled in for a double. Jason Kubel then lined out to short to end the inning.&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>Leyland:</b> I remember (Porcello) being real aggressive … with his stuff. I’m sure he was pumped up, but it wasn’t like he was fazed at all, to be honest with you. I’m sure there were some emotions running, but you’d have never really known it. He was there to compete. He was a young guy, he was aggressive, he just went after them. He was fantastic.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><b>Porcello:</b> It was incredibly loud. The biggest memory I have — which is kind of a weird one because there were some incredible games — but the first base hit that I gave up was to Mauer. But the sound and the crowd, it sounded like it was a three-run homer. And it just sticks out to me how loud it was, really, that was one of the few atmospheres that I really couldn’t hear myself think when, you know, there was runners on base or in a bit of a jam.</p><table class="table table-condensed table-bordered"><tbody><tr bgcolor=#0c2340><td valign=top></td><td valign=top><strong>1</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>2</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>3</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>4</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>5</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>6</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>7</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>8</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>9</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>R</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>H</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>E</strong></td></tr><tr><td valign=top>Tigers</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>0</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>Twins</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>1</td><td valign=top>0</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Second inning</b></h3><p><i>Miguel Cabrera took a pitch left over the plate for a leadoff double. Carlos Guillen flew out to center, but the Tigers put runners on the corners after a Ryan Raburn bloop-single to right. Baker escaped after a Brandon Inge lineout and a Gerald Laird popout.</i></p><p><b>Anderson</b>: It was unbelievable. Every pitch affected the game. Both teams, it was just a battle. … It was one of those games — you’re on the edge of your seat the whole time, even coaching.</p><p><b>Justin Morneau, Twins first baseman:</b> (Baker) was just a guy that — it’s like every time you looked up, there was nothing. I mean it’s not like he was a pitcher who threw 98 with a wipeout slider or anything. He just threw four pitches for strikes and you looked up and he was in the sixth or seventh inning here and gave us a chance to win pretty much every time we went out there.</p><p><i>Porcello got through the second easily, getting Michael Cuddyer to ground out, then striking out Delmon Young and Morales swinging.</i></p><p><b>Inge: </b>The funny part about Rick … when he thinks about how to pitch — and this is just going into Porcello’s head, having talked to him many times — he’s trying to think the game through instead of being a kid and just going out there and competing. That was one of the main times where we saw that if he would just stop thinking and go out there and compete like he was a high-school kid on the mound somewhere, he’s better off. That’s all he did. He wasn’t thinking about anything. He wasn’t thinking about pitch selection or how he was going to throw a pitch or mechanics. He was just literally out there doing it, and it was one of the best games I’ve seen him throw.</p><p><b>Porcello: </b>I remember it was pretty much everything I could do to keep my emotions in check, and slow the moment down, and be able to go out there and just perform. I remember, the entire day taking deep breaths and trying to calm myself down and just think about simple things as far as pitching goes. I think that would help me just keep my focus on the game and not think about everything else that was a do-or-die situation.</p><table class="table table-condensed table-bordered"><tbody><tr bgcolor=#0c2340><td valign=top></td><td valign=top><strong><span>1</span></strong></td><td valign=top><strong>2</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>3</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>4</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>5</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>6</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>7</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>8</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>9</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>R</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>H</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>E</strong></td></tr><tr><td valign=top>Tigers</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>2</td><td valign=top>0</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>Twins</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>1</td><td valign=top>0</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Third inning</h3><p>With two outs in the inning, Ordonez singled to score Curtis Granderson, who had walked and advanced to second on a groundout, and put the Tigers up 1-0. Miguel Cabrera, who had been questioned by police earlier in the year after reportedly driving with a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit and getting in an altercation with his wife, faced chants of “AL-CO-HOLIC” as he came to the plate. Cabrera blasted a two-run home run to center field on an 0-2 pitch to hush the crowd and give the Tigers a 3-0 lead.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cabrera:</strong> It was one of the loudest games I’ve ever played in my career. … (The home run) opened up the game. I think it gave us a lot of confidence that we could win this game here in Minnesota.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Punto:</strong> (Baker) could have fell apart when Miguel Cabrera hit that big home run, but he didn’t. He stayed in there. He had three great pitches. He knew how to pitch. He used both sides of the plate. He was definitely a guy we were excited to have on the mound with a team like that.</p><p><strong>Joe Nathan, Twins closer:</strong> When Miggy hit the three-run homer early and it was, it almost was like a sinking feeling like, “Oh man, this is not, I just don’t got a good feel right now. It doesn’t feel like this is heading in our favor.”</p><p>With the bullpen starting to stir, Baker struck out Guillen to end the inning.</p><p><strong>Gardenhire:</strong> We were definitely talking about (making a pitching change). You just couldn’t get behind, it was one of those games. Their bullpen was strong at the end, and they could make it probably a five- or six-inning game, and then go to those guys. We knew the same thing, but we had so much confidence in (Baker) and he’d pitched really well against that team.</p><p>Tolbert led off with an infield single (a diving stop by Inge at third likely prevented a double). Punto struck out swinging, but Span singled into left field to put two runners on. After an Orlando Cabrera fly out, Tolbert tagged to put runners on the corners. Porcello made an errant pickoff throw to first base, allowing Tolbert to score.</p><p><strong>Gardenhire:</strong> The one thing we did back then was put the ball in play. We had the scat backs that could slap the ball around and that’s kind of how we got back into it.</p><p>Mauer walked and Zach Miner started to warm up in the Tigers bullpen.</p><p><strong>Porcello:</strong> Basically go be closer every inning. Put up as many zeros as I can, get as many outs as I can and take us as far as we can go, you know? And that was it. I knew if I had given up two or three runs early, I probably would’ve been out of that game. You know how playoff games are usually managed. It didn’t bother me at all. I knew there was going to be action like that. And you know those games can erupt quickly. You’ve got to be prepared for any situation.</p><p>Porcello struck out Kubel to end the inning and prevent further damage. The Tigers led 3-1.</p><p><strong>Porcello:</strong> Kubel was the guy in that lineup that I had a really hard time with. He hit a bunch of home runs off me that year. It seemed like every time he came up he’s hitting a double or a homer. And I got him out the first two at-bats and it was like, it was big for me, my confidence level, because I got by that guy. I felt really good about how I was attacking the rest of the lineup.</p><p><strong>Kubel:</strong> I think (Porcello) struck me out on something, on one high too. … He was a sinkerballer, so you’re looking down and if he can continuously just keep throwing it up and hard, that’ll make it tough on you.</p><table class="table table-condensed table-bordered"><tbody><tr bgcolor=#0c2340><td valign=top></td><td valign=top><strong>1</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>2</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>3</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>4</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>5</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>6</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>7</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>8</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>9</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>R</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>H</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>E</strong></td></tr><tr><td valign=top>Tigers</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>3</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>3</td><td valign=top>4</td><td valign=top>1</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>Twins</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>1</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>1</td><td valign=top>3</td><td valign=top>0</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Fourth inning</h3><p>Raburn singled to begin the inning, and Anderson went out to visit Baker after he fell behind in the count to Inge.</p><p><strong>Mauer:</strong> You didn’t really have to tell (Baker) too much. He wasn’t one of those guys that you needed to get on. I think he was just more of like, “Hey, let’s let the past be the past … what’s happened happened. What can we do to go from here?” And you know, Scott was very professional, worked hard and he knew what he needed to do, but a lot of those times, those meetings were just to go out there and just give him a breather, especially with everything that was on the line that day.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Baker got Inge to foul out, then got Laird to bounce into a 5-4-3 double play (as Punto avoided a takeout slide from Raburn at second base).</p><p><strong>Punto:</strong> That was way before Chase Utley rule. That was just good old hard nose Jim Leyland baseball right there, Ryan Raburn. Ryan Raburn was one of those guys. … It’s funny, I was laughing with (former MLB second baseman) Skip Schumaker the other day, we were talking about how easy it would be to be a second baseman in the major leagues today, not having to worry about Jose Guillén or Michael Cuddyer or Ryan Raburn or some of these guys that are out to kill you. Like literally, they cannot wait to get in there and made sure there’s some sort of car wreck at second base. They’re not trying to hurt you. They just want to see a nice car wreck.</p><p>Porcello regained his composure in the fourth, retiring Cuddyer, Young and Morales in order and bringing his strikeout total to six.</p><p><strong>Porcello:</strong> (Throwing the fastball at the top of the zone) is something that I do now a lot, and at that time I didn’t know how much of a weapon that was — that those pitches played off one another. I honestly, I didn’t do it for several years after that. I focused so hard on my sinker that I kind of didn’t look at that game and realize how effective forcing was off that. I didn’t necessarily take advantage of how well that it worked early on in my career.</p><p><strong>Anderson:</strong> Both sides — Porcello, in that kind of a situation, you would think going in, “OK, we got this rookie. Let’s see how he handles it.” Well, my God, he’s been pitching a long time, it looks like. Just both sides. Nobody was in awe. Nobody was trying to do too much. It was just fun to watch.</p><table class="table table-condensed table-bordered"><tbody><tr bgcolor=#0c2340><td valign=top></td><td valign=top><strong>1</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>2</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>3</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>4</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>5</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>6</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>7</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>8</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>9</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>R</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>H</strong></td><td valign=top><strong>E</strong></td></tr><tr><td valign=top>Tigers</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>3</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>3</td><td valign=top>5</td><td valign=top>1</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>Twins</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>1</td><td valign=top>0</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>–</td><td valign=top>1</td><td valign=top>3</td><td valign=top>0</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Fifth inning</b></h3><p><i>Baker allowed a two-out Polanco single, but Ordonez grounded into a fielder’s choice to end the inning and keep the score at 3-1.&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>Gardenhire:</b> (Baker) could elevate the baseball, which was good against them at the time.

But I know we faced him enough times to have a good idea that we were at least going to be able to scratch a few runs across the board.</p><p><i>Porcello got Orlando Cabrera to fly out, then recorded his eighth strikeout when Mauer couldn’t hold up on a high fastball.

Like I got a lot of that ball. That’s a good feeling. It got real loud and gave us a little bit more life, but that let us know that we’re still in this, we’re definitely in this thing.

They were so loud, and it’s just sounding off the dome and echoing around. Honest to God, I think we all had headaches on the plane home, just from the noise.

My first at-bat I struck out on fastballs up and (Porcello is) a sinkerballer, especially that year. He really relied on the two-seamer and he was throwing 94-96 that game, throwing fastballs up. I had to change my game plan. I had to re-shift my thinking, my approach and that kind of helped me work the walk because I kind of widened what I was looking for, which allowed me to shrink my zone.</p><p><i>Young singled to put runners on the corners, then Miner hit Brendan Harris on the left elbow to load the bases.

They played their ass off. There’s two good teams, and this is it.</p><p><b>Punto:</b> Porcello was tough. He was just tough because he kept lefties at bay with that cutter. I mean it was just, you could cut it right on top of your hands. He could sink it away. So he was just very effective. He’s an innings-eater. It was hard to make him throw pitches because a lot of his pitches were strikes, so it wasn’t like we were going to be able to get into the bullpen off a guy like that.

I’m thinking maybe he might think that I’m going to try to come inside hard to set something up away. And so I thought maybe I could start a slider off the plate and he’ll freeze.

Once I saw him hit the ground ball, obviously being close to second it worried me a little bit, but then it rolled into center field.</p><p><b>Crain: </b>Afterwards, you’re mad.

Either way, I thought it was over.</p><p><b>Punto: </b>I really did think it was over. They had to be played perfect. Ryan Rayburn was out there playing me perfect. But I had Alexi Casilla, who was young, super heady, very fast base runner. So I knew that all I had to do is get one in the air and he was going to be able to tag up. And unfortunately I don’t think he had time to get back to the bag to tag up, if you go back and look at it.

Mike and I were tasked with three or four guys to do interviews. You don’t know who’s the hero and the guy that sets it up, the winning pitcher, whatever. The Metrodome had 44 stairs up and down.

And with the severity of this game, one, when that thing hit me, I knew it hit me. Two, I was gonna take my base because it was a huge, huge base in that game. So I argued. And I argued like, very surprised I didn’t get ejected, to be honest with you. Because there was many, many, many things said within a very short period of time, that was very uncharacteristic of what I would normally be like, because of the situation. (The umpire) understood it. But at the end of the day, you got to try and make the best of what happened, and it didn’t work out.

You could see the shirt kind of move. So we were pretty sure, but there was really nothing you could do about it. The umpire said no. And I understand that. I respect that. It’s not that easy of a call. But no sour grapes about that. It’s just funny though, how it turns out. If you have replay, that whole game could be different, possibly.

But he comes home with it and gets the guy out. We get the strikeout of Laird behind him. That’s amazing. That play was like, “Wow.”</p><p><b>Punto:</b> I didn’t think that me and Cabrera could turn two, not on Brandon Inge. I know how hard he runs down the first-base line. … I know that he hit it off his front foot and he hit. He was going to beat that out if I tried to flip that ball to Cabrera and get a double play.

Romero for an A-ball wild card-type prospect, and it was Alexi Casilla. I remember Terry being proud of the scouting staff and a lot of the people involved in identifying Alexi as a potential major-leaguer. And then he had such an impact on one of the biggest games in Twins history.

I don’t remember any moves that I made that I second-guessed myself. I don’t know if I managed great. I managed like I always managed. I tried to put my players in the best spot to win the game, and I felt comfortable with the way I managed the game. I’m sure Gardy did, too. But we lost the game and they won.</p><p><b>Liddle:</b>&nbsp;Two guys who didn’t start the game won the game. Carlos Gomez wound up scoring the winning run, and Alexi Casilla wound up driving it in with a base hit. It just happened to be a good matchup. Alexi had numbers off Rodney. I remember, because I kept a chart on the bench of our hitters versus the opposition’s bullpen. Alexi had numbers off of Rodney, and it just so happened that he came up in that situation, and he was able to drive a ball through the infield, and Gomez scored with a headfirst slide and ended the heavyweight match. Just a tremendous game. It was really sad that someone had to lose.</p><p><b>Vavra:</b>&nbsp;Gomez was flying.

The Twins met the Yankees for a 6 p.m. game the next night, and with a depleted bullpen, got swept in three games. In 2010, the Twins said goodbye to the Metrodome and moved to Target Field. In 2011, Sports Illustrated named Game 163 the best regular-season game of the previous decade. In 2012, Major League Baseball added a second wild-card team and a yearly one-game wild-card round in each league.</i></p><p><b>Morse: </b>Bobby and I decided to carpool together because he was living in a guy’s basement in Shakopee, Minn., and I was living in Shakopee at the time. Of all guys, I wasn’t extremely close to Bobby Keppel. He was a great person and a really nice guy, so he offered me a ride. … I remember driving with him to the airport and both are just dissecting the game and I remember looking at him and saying, “You’re the answer to one of the more epic Twins trivia questions of all time. Who was the winning pitcher of Game 163?” He just kind of chuckled. It was unbelievable.</p><p><b>Morneau: </b>If you were to quiz me on that one, I probably would have forgot.</p><p><b>Liddle:</b>&nbsp;Out of everything that happened in that game, the thing that will stick with me for the rest of my life, is both teams had so much respect for each other, that at the end of the game we shook hands. You just don’t see that in pro ball. You just don’t see that. It was a mutual respect everybody had for each other, because, what a game!</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><b>Santiago:</b>&nbsp;I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you right away: That’s one of the best games I ever played. I played in a World Series before, and for me, that’s still one of the best games. For me, that’s like a Super Bowl. You don’t got tomorrow. You got to play all-out that day. … I have a CD of that game in my house. I’ve gone back and looked at it a couple of times. … It’s still one of the best games I’ve ever played.</p><p><b>Mauer: </b>It was like a heavyweight bout, you know? That’s what I remember, the whole game just back and forth. It probably wasn’t the most well played or clean game I’ve ever been a part of, but it was definitely the most entertaining and just exciting game I’ve ever been a part of.</p><p><b>Vavra</b>: There was a big on-field celebration, then we all went into the locker room and had a total celebration. Then somebody came down and said, “Hey, there’s 55,000 people out there that aren’t going to go away.” So everybody went up and the players started parading around and high-fiving fans up in the stands and stuff. But then it was over, man. We had to get on a plane.</p><p><b>Liddle:</b> I think it kind of created today’s wild-card situation. I think MLB may have saw, “Hey, look at the excitement from this one-game playoff.” If you’re a wild-card team — neither one of us were able to set out pitching — and really, it hurt us. And it would have hurt the Tigers, too, to use all your pitching for just one game, and then go and play a series with the Yankees. You can’t limp into a series with the Yankees after having a bloodbath the night before, playing Game 163. So anyway, it hurt us in the next series. We fought so hard to get in. It really was unfair for the next series. But what a game.</p><p><b>Leyland</b>: It was one of the greatest games in the history of baseball. One of them. It would rank in the top, I don’t know how many games, but it would rank as one of the best games ever played. It was really a postseason game without the title of postseason. How could you have a better game for baseball people — players, fans, everybody involved?</p><p><b>Inge</b>: I remember being worn out and completely exhausted mentally and physically at the end of that sucker. That was the best and worst game I’ve ever been a part of. Two teams went at it like I’ve never seen and never been a part of, so that was the best competition I’ve ever faced, as far as back and forth, but the worst outcome. I guess there’s a silver lining, because we were so tired — either team that won, it didn’t matter — we were going into a fresh, hot New York Yankees and were gonna get spanked anyway. But honest to God, it was probably one of my favorite games playing. The atmosphere there, I’ve never — World Series, anything — I’ve never been in an environment quite like that.</p><p><b>Inge</b>: I’m telling you what: I wouldn’t change anything, results or anything. I would still want to be a part of that game if it was played tomorrow. It’s why we play the game, to be honest with you. It’s why we should play the game — to compete on a stage like that.</p><p>(Top photo: Bruce Kluckhohn/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57kGtramtiZXxzfJByZmlxX2eEcMDWoqWsZaSetKa%2B0mZpaWhpYq6tecKepa2qkaF6tbXEm6memZuav2670ZqjZqCZqMGwvthmq6GdXZeytMCMoJimnV2ptabFjJ6tnqpdpbmixcSdZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./toni-braxton-siblings-exploring-the-braxton-legacy.html>&#171;&nbsp;Toni Braxton Siblings: Exploring the Braxton Legacy</a>
