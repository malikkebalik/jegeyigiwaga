In that sense, he‚Äôs been part of a three-man rotation this season, splitting time with Myles Jack and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Devin Bush</a>.</p><p>On Sunday, his playing time took a significant jump, when Jack‚Äôs nagging knee injury thrust Spillane into a starting role. The 6-foot-1, 229-pound Spillane embraced the opportunity, playing all 47 defensive snaps ‚Äî the first time he‚Äôs played 100 percent of the snaps in a game this season ‚Äî and racking up a team-leading seven tackles. That included a critical fourth down stop of <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Andy Dalton</a> on a QB sneak, which helped seal Sunday‚Äôs victory over the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Saints</a>.</p><p lang=und dir=ltr>Moooood <a href=#>@14rspillane</a><a href=#>@Budlight</a> | <a href=#>#BudLightCelly</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gkbk7ub0xB</a></p><p>‚Äî Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) <a href=#>November 13, 2022</a></p><p>‚ÄúI was ready to go,‚Äù Spillane said. ‚ÄúI prepare myself to be a starter every week. So when the opportunity arose, I was ready for it.‚Äù</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Feeding off T.J. Watt's return, Steelers' D dominates vs. Saints without Minkah Fitzpatrick</p></a><p>But for Spillane ‚Äî a football junkie who will tell anyone who will listen that he will be a coach one day ‚Äî his job description is often broader than one single position. His holistic view of the game extends beyond just defense, and his unique training regimen sometimes has little to do with football.</p><p>Spillane is the grandson of 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner, so football has been in his family‚Äôs blood for generations. Even as a kid, he played any position that would get him into the action.</p><p>‚ÄúI played every position on the field, whether that be center, right guard, defensive end, corner, safety,‚Äù Spillane said. ‚ÄúI think that versatility has definitely helped me develop my game and understand what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>After a standout career at the Chicago-area Fenwick High School, Spillane was recruited by P.J. Fleck to play running back at Western Michigan. A somewhat under-the-radar three-star prospect, Spillane eventually made the transition to linebacker. He‚Äôd go on to rack up 312 tackles (32.5 for loss), 10 sacks, four interceptions, nine pass breakups and a pair of second-team All-MAC honors over four seasons.</p><p>‚ÄúRobert is a throwback,‚Äù Fleck told reporters in Western Michigan years back. ‚ÄúRobert probably should have played back in the ‚Äô60s and ‚Äô70s. That‚Äôs how tough he is. He‚Äôs an old-school player in a new era of football.‚Äù</p><p>Spillane‚Äôs path through professional football only reinforced that identity and encouraged him to expand his knowledge of the game. Overlooked at the draft, he signed with the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tennessee Titans</a> as a free agent in 2018. The following season, he made the jump to Pittsburgh, where he began the upward climb from practice squad to special teamer to backup linebacker.</p><p>He was still mostly toiling on the outskirts of the roster until 2020, when Bush‚Äôs torn ACL provided an opportunity to step into a starting role. His pad-rattling goal-line stand against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Derrick Henry</a> and his pick six against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Lamar Jackson</a> helped prove himself to the coaching staff and his teammates.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Robert Spillane's family was hype for his pick-six on Sunday üôå <a href=#>@14rspillane</a> <a href=#>@steelers</a></p><p>(via dlatto) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/g2rj687UHx</a></p><p>‚Äî The Checkdown (@thecheckdown) <a href=#>November 2, 2020</a></p><p><br>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a very versatile player,‚Äù <a class=ath_autolink href=#>T.J. Watt</a> said. ‚ÄúHe can blitz well. He can cover well, and he‚Äôs just a good communicator. That‚Äôs super important, especially when we‚Äôre at home (and the fans are loud). He did a great job today of just communicating, and he made some big plays for us.‚Äù</p><p>In years since his Steelers defensive debut, Spillane has carved out a niche for himself thanks in large part to his preparation, versatility and communication skills. That‚Äôs especially been on display this season when Pittsburgh has unveiled a personnel grouping with all three inside linebackers on the field at the same time.</p><p>What‚Äôs unique about that package, really, is Spillane‚Äôs role within it. Sometimes, he‚Äôs representing a safety. Sometimes he‚Äôs a nickel. Sometimes he‚Äôs a will linebacker. Other times, he‚Äôs a sam ‚Äòbacker. Spillane calls himself the ‚Äúadjuster‚Äù in those situations, adapting his responsibilities based on the defensive call, the offensive formation and pre-snap shifts.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve always strived to have a deep understanding of defensive football,‚Äù Spillane said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve studied the game for many years, and I never wanted to just understand what the linebackers were doing. I always want to have a big-picture mentality. I love doing what I do, so I take it to heart. I really study the game and understand what‚Äôs going on around me.‚Äù</p><p>The 26-year-old linebacker not only embraces that role, but he hopes to see it grow. Spillane is quick to point out that he was part of some goal-line offensive packages on the scout team during his first season in Pittsburgh. He jokes that he‚Äôs still lobbying for a few snaps on that side of the ball.</p><p>Then you realize he‚Äôs not joking.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm still waiting for my opportunity to play some slot receiver,‚Äù Spillane said. ‚ÄúI still run routes every day.‚Äù</p><p>This cross-training approach extends into the offseason. Spillane designs his unique training plan that draws from many different disciplines. Sometimes he‚Äôs running routes and playing basketball. Other times he‚Äôs training with his eyes closed to develop body awareness. As a new challenge during this most recent offseason, he did 30 consecutive days of hot yoga.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sweating after four minutes and grandpa next to me doesn‚Äôt start sweating until minute 60,‚Äù Spillane said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt feel so good about yourself.‚Äù</p><p>All of this is in an effort to broaden his skill set and develop his ‚Äúfull athletic potential.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI never tried to put a box on myself,‚Äù Spillane said. ‚ÄúI believe that I‚Äôm just kind of scraping the surface of where I can be.‚Äù</p><p>Part of the reason Spillane prepares like this is that he‚Äôs made it his mission to become a coach one day. Mike Tomlin said that ‚Äúevery day‚Äù Spillane displays attributes of someone studying to be a coach.</p><p>‚ÄúWe have a lot of guys with that mentality and maybe those aspirations,‚Äù Tomlin said. ‚ÄúI tell each and every one of them, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt quit your day job, man. There‚Äôs more money in playing.‚Äô But I just think as a coach, as somebody that loves football, you appreciate that shared spirit.‚Äù</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>It remains to be seen how Spillane‚Äôs role on the Steelers defense may evolve, this year and beyond. When Jack is healthy, Spillane has typically played around 35 percent of the defensive snaps, with Jack near 90 percent and Bush close to 70 percent. Spillane is also scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent for the first time ‚Äî as is Bush‚Äî this spring.</p><p>But based on his passion for the game and preparation, it‚Äôs safe to say the kid who called his own plays as a youth quarterback will likely be making many more play calls long after his career is over.</p><p>(Photo: Justin K.
