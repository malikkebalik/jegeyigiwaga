Thereafter, she decided to pursue a career in the Makeup industry because she loved to make actors and models look beautiful and glamorous; according to her, she loved working behind the scene with superstars and didn’t want to be in front of the camera at all because of her insecurities, but as several people mounted pressure on her to become a plus-size model, she eventually caved in and pursued that dream after resisting the suggestions for a very long time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Professional_Career></span><strong>Professional Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Latecia has been a makeup artist for about a decade prior to commencing her modeling career in 2016; she has stated in several interviews that all she ever wanted to be was a makeup artist – who makes the stars more beautiful, and it was suggestions and pressures from her clients, friends, and well-wishers that pushed her to become a model.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Her_Relationship_with_Lil_Wayne></span><strong>Her Relationship with Lil Wayne</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Latecia really became more famous when news broke out that she was dating multiple award-winning rapper, Dwayne Michael Carter&nbsp;Jr – popularly known as Lil’ Wayne.

Early in 2020, her fans began to notice her donning a large diamond-studded ring showing that she was engaged, though she was initially coy about who she was engaged with she later revealed that it was the rapper, and a lot of fans were really happy for them, hoping that wedding bells would toll for them soon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Latecia_Thomas_and_Lil_Wayne_Broke_Up></span><b>Why Latecia Thomas and Lil’ Wayne Broke Up</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Latecia-Thomas-e1603952198835.jpg><p>Around May 2020,&nbsp;Latecia’s&nbsp;fans began to notice that she was no longer wearing the “Carter” necklace and engagement ring in her pictures posted online, and rumors and speculations about what could have happened to end their engagement began to fly about.</p><p>Some speculated that the relationship of the pair turned sour because of the emergence of the rappers side chick named Kimberly Rose – meaning that he was unfaithful in the relationship, while another school of thought suggested that Latecia was being abused by the rapper and threatened to expose secrets of this to the public. There are those who claimed the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> relationship was ended</a> by Wayne.</p><p>Since there is no official reason for the breakup from both parties, all we have now in the public space are unofficial reasons that should be taken with a pinch of salt; and there is a possibility that they may still get back together&nbsp;possibly in the future.</p><p>Before her, the rapper dated other women including<a href=#> Dhea Sodano</a>, Christina Milan, and many others.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Her_Current_Relationship_Status></span><strong>Her Current Relationship Status</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is currently not linked with anybody or confirmed to be in any relationship yet.
