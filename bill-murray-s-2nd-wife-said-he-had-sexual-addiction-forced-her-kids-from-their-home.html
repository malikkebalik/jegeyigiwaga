Over the years, his mastery in show business has made him the recipient of different awards, including the Golden Globe and the British Academy Film Award.</p><p class=dh>Murray decided he was ready to become a family man when he married his first wife Margaret Kelly during the filming of "Stripes" on January 25, 1981.</p><p class=dh>They had a similar ceremony in Chicago to honor their families, and throughout their marriage, the couple welcomed two sons, Homer and Luke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/acea77a5268d147441c2982b6c32db69706061561759305.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Murray attends the American Film Institute's 46th Life Achievement Award Gala Tribute to George Clooney on June 7, 2018 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>However, things didn't go smoothly for the couple during their time as husband and wife because Murray was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.baltimoresun.com/la-et-billmurraydivorce-29may29-story.html>having an affair</a> with Jennifer Butler while still married Kelly.

But, she offered proper visitation for the actor so long as he behaved appropriately.</p><p class=dh>Butler, who described herself as a "devoted and faithful wife," further aimed to stop the actor from exposing the children to drugs or his romantic affairs.

Jackson has made a few appearances on social media, and Cooper played a small part in "Moonrise Kingdom."

During an interview, while speaking about the loneliness he experienced after his mother died, Murray <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/oct/22/features.weekend>revealed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"There is also that little-discussed subject -- loneliness. That is a great taboo, isn't it? No one really wants to admit they are lonely[...]. But I have felt lonely many times in my life."</p><p class=dh>But it is unclear if he experienced any form of loneliness after Butler passed away as he has been very open about being happy with his single life. Once speaking in an interview, the Hollywood star <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2014/10/10/Bill-Murray-says-he-is-single-but-not-lonely/2591412954407/>said</a>, "I have kids that I'm responsible for. I don't think I'm lonely."</p><p class=dh>The 71-year-old movie icon further admitted it would be nice having a date on special occasions, but he was working on other things that he needed doing. When asked what those things were, Murray said he was working on "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/10/bill-murray-girlfriend>self-development</a>."</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Murray</a> also stole the show at an American's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-murray-marriage-speech-2014-5?r=US&IR=T">bachelor party</a> with his love and relationship theory. The actor, who resides in Charleston, South Carolina, was at a gathering filled with a male audience when a person spontaneously invited him to say something to the soon-to-be groom.</p><p class=dh>He said that Bachelor parties aren't for the grooms but the unmarried. His statement drew a lot of laughter from other guests, but that wasn't all he said.</p><p class=dh>A <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fx6exbiWhw">YouTube clip</a> also features the actor advising what to do with a girl one loves. He explained that lovers should travel around the world and when the vacation ends, they should get married if they are still in love.</p><p class=dh>Although the "Lost in Translation" actor's statement also got people laughing, it seemed his words came from years of experience in different relationships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtva2pobnqzu8KksGalkae%2Fqq3GnmSboZyheq7B0auYsqtdZ7uledainZ5lk6Gub7TTpqM%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./carin-le%C3%B3n-bio-wiki-age-height-family-wife-children-music-albums-and-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Carin Len Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Wife, Children, Music, Albums, and Net Worth</a>
