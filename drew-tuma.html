At the age of 30, he accepts American citizenship. Furthermore, he has kept his family details private, but he spends quality time with his family and frequently posts photos of them on his social media sites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marrieddivorce.com/uploads/images/celebrity/Drew-Tuma-mothers-dayF.JPG?ezimgfmt=rs:566x566/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1"><p>During his high school years, he was interested in math and science, and he was a member of his school’s weather club.

On November 12, 2017, he shared a picture with fellow anchor Natasha Zouves. According to the captions, the two were on a dinner date. But there was nothing else on the subject.</p><p>The meteorologist is not currently involved in any romantic relationships, or perhaps he is too good at hiding them. There are a plethora of possibilities in his love life. Behind the curtains, he might even be enjoying his married life. But, since he hasn’t even mentioned his potential girlfriend, the discussion of his marital life can be put on hold. Another reason to disregard his marital status is that he is openly gay.</p><h2>How does Drew Tuma start his career?</h2><p>Drew was fascinated by weather and all of its secrets from a young age; in 1996, he was astounded by a blizzard that dumped 40 inches of snow in a matter of minutes, and he immediately decided that a career in meteorology was his true calling. He completed his internship at CBS 3 from May 2009 to August of the same year, mentored by Kathy Orr and Doug Kammerer, which aided him greatly in his future career. Drew then joined WHSV TV3 Winchester as a chief meteorologist, a position he held from September 2010 to December 2013. He could be seen on-air Monday through Friday at 6, 7, and 11 a.m. His experience grew exponentially, and in December 2013, he received a job offer from Fox Television, which he gladly accepted.</p><h2><span id=Drew_Tuma_Personal_Life_Marriage_Dating_Is_He_Gay>&nbsp;Is Drew Tuma Gay?</span></h2><p>Drew Tuma has been openly gay for many years. He is a strong supporter of the LGBTQ community and openly expresses his love for his gay peers.</p><p>In June 2017, the meteorologist participated in a conversation about the gay community moderated by ABC7’s Cheryl Jennings. Drew was accompanied by his gay coworker, Reggie Aqui. Sister Roma, a twenty-year member of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, and Jeff Cotter, the founder of Rainbow World Fund, were both guests at the discussion. Each shared their perspectives on being gay. Drew’s gay characteristics, which are followed by his flamboyance, are not hidden. He does not let his sexuality define his talents as a proud member of the gay community. He hasn’t told his followers about his gay partner.</p><h2>Quick Information</h2><ul class=quickList><li><strong>Date of Birth=</strong>Jun 17, 1988</li><li><strong>Age=</strong>33 Years, 1 Month</li><li><strong>Nationality=</strong>American</li><li><strong>Profession=</strong>Journalist</li><li><strong>Marital Status=</strong>Single</li><li><strong>Gay/Lesbain=</strong>No</li><li><strong>Ethnicity=</strong>White</li><li><strong>Net Worth=$1 million</strong></li><li><strong>Height=</strong>N/A</li><li><strong>Education=</strong>Penn State University</li><li><strong>Siblings=</strong>One</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaJyimsRuwNSmmGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-a-b-quintanilla-ex-wife-rikkie-leigh-robertson-single-or-dating.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is A.B.
