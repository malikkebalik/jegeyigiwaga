Throughout the years, his wife supported him and baked goods for his former co-workers. Her untimely death ended a 32-year love story, and he appears to have changed a lot since her death.</p><p class=dh>Steve Buscemi is an American actor recognized mostly for portraying diverse roles as the bad guy, gangster, and mysterious man in Hollywood classics. Some of his earliest works include playing Willy in his debut film "The Way It Is," then Nick in the 1986 "Parting Glances," and an appearance as Rickles in an episode of "Miami Vice."</p><p class=dh>His breakthrough came in the 90s when he appeared as Mink in the neo-noir gangster film "Millers Crossing," the first of five of the Coen Brothers' films. The same year, he appeared as Test Tube, a henchman in the crime thriller "King of New York," and as Edward in the anthology film "Tales from the Darkside: The Movie."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dd1e7376e3564269a185aa884f187a5ea19b986b43e795dd382dc817f9641119.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>US actor Steve Buscemi arrives for the premiere of "If These Walls Could Sing," at the Metrograph in New York City on December 7, 2022. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In 1991, he appeared in yet another cult classic as the bellboy Chet in the black comedy "Barton Fink."
