Lucie Arnaz has earned her huge net worth through appearing on TV and on the big screen, as well as in musicals on stage. Lucie comes from a family of actors as she is a daughter of a famous actress Lucille Ball and an actor and musician <a href=#>Desi Arnaz</a>. Her brother <a href=#>Desi Arnaz, Jr.</a> has also become an actor. Lucie Arnaz has been acting since 1968 and is still active today, therefore it easy to see how she accumulated her impressive net worth.</p><h3>Lucie Arnaz Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>Lucie Arnaz was born in 1951 in Los Angeles and grew up there. As she comes from a family of actors it was not difficult for her to begin her career as an actress as well. She made a debut in a famous show “I Love Lucie” where both her parents appeared. However, it was only one walk-on appearance for Lucie, and her role in another show of her mother called “The Lucie Show” was also small. The real achievement for Lucie Arnaz was “Here’s Lucy” in which she appeared from 1968 until 1974. In this show, too, the main role of Lucie was played by Lucie’s mother <a href=#>Lucille Ball</a>, while the young Lucie played her daughter Kim Carter.</p><p>When “The Lucy Show” was finished Lucie Arnaz moved on from family related projects and began advancing her career as well earning her net worth on her own. The first role that she got was in 1975 in “Who is the Black Dahlia” where Lucie played a real-life murder victim Elisabeth Short. Later in 1978 Lucie appeared in one episode of the famous TV series “Fantasy Island”. While her own TV show “The Lucie Arnaz Show” which came out in 1985 proved not very successful, Lucie herself continued working on television and appeared in such famous TV series as “Murder She Wrote”, “Sons and Daughters”, and “Law and Order”, among others.</p><p>Lucie Arnaz increased her popularity as well as net worth by acting on the big screen, too. One performance in particular was very successful for her and even brought her a nomination for Golden Globe awards in the category of best supporting actress. That was the 1980 remake of a 1927 hit movie “The Jazz Singer” where Lucie appeared along with the famous actor Laurence Olivier and a singer <a href=#>Neil Diamond</a>.</p><p>Another area of Lucie Arnaz’s activities and a source of her net worth is musical theater. She began playing in theater from the late 70’s and one of her first appearances was in Long Island’s Jones Beach Theater’s production “Annie Get Your Gun” where she played the main role. A year later she debuted on the Broadway stage in a musical called “They’re Playing Our Song”. Since then she has played in numerous musicals and received several awards including Theatre World Award and Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award.</p><p>Lucie is also known for her work in the fields other than acting, one of which was running the <a href=#>Lucille Ball</a>–<a href=#>Desi Arnaz</a> Center.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=20.650643776824><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Lucie Arnaz</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 17, 1951</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 9 in (1.77 m)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Film Producer, Singer, Dancer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Immaculate Heart High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Laurence Luckinbill (m. 1980), Phil Vandervort (m. 1971–1977)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Katharine Luckinbill, Joseph Luckinbill, Simon Luckinbill</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Desi Arnaz, Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Lucie Desiree Arnaz , Lucie Désirée Arnaz</td></tr><tr readability=0.32><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/luciearnazofficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34615384615385><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/luciearnazofficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0036109</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>Theatre World Award, Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture, Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Programs</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Movies</td><td>“Who is the Black Dahlia” (1975), “Fantasy Island” (1978), “Murder She Wrote” (1988), “Sons and Daughters” (1991), and “Law and Order” (2003)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Here’s Lucy” (1968-1974), “The Lucie Arnaz Show” (1985), The Lucy Show (1962-1963)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=18.030023094688><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=8><td>1</td><td>Everybody has a unique, interesting story to tell.

But, in fact, Lucy Ricardo never really wanted it bad enough to go get it. It just made for good comedy. My mother gets a lot of credit for being the first-woman-this and the first-woman-that.
