Despite their seemingly perfect marriage, Abe nearly lost Rose from his life when she left him and moved to Paris as he wasn't paying her any attention. After jumping through several hoops to prove that he loved and cared for her, Abe finally managed to woo back Rose into his life. Sadly, it looks like the Weissmans' are headed towards another new issue.</p><p>Season 4 of 'The Marvelous Mrs Maisel' kicked off with Abe starting a new job as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reporter</a> at a local newspaper house. Unfortunately, one of Abe's articles caught the attention of the FBI leading to them approaching Abe and his best friend Asher Friedman (Jason Alexander) for an investigation of arson that they had committed in their younger days. A fuming Asher landed at Abe's doorstep accusing him of putting their lives at stake with his article. But after Abe's lawyer diffused the situation by revealing that the FBI had nothing against them, the duo heaved a sigh of relief, before another fire popped up. During their dinner conversation, Asher casually slipped in that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rose</a> and he dated briefly.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'The Marvelous Mrs Maisel' star Tony Shalhoub on how he reinvented his character as Midge's dad for Season 3</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'The Marvelous Mrs Maisel' Season 4: Fans love premiere episodes but haven't forgiven Midge</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7e174c7c-4280-498e-b4ee-254ef4c8f75a.png><p><a href=# rel>Miriam "Midge" Maisel</a> (Rachel Brosnahan) was surprised to learn that her mother dated her father's best friend, and began asking questions about it. Even though Abe was initially nonchalant about it, he later began feeling upset and suspicious when Asher revealed that they dated for two months. He was also unhappy over the fact that his wife described Asher as a handsome man back in the day. Even though Rose made it clear that she dated Asher while she was on a break from Abe, it still seemed to upset him that his beloved wife dated some other man.&nbsp;</p><p>Abe got his payback when he later snitched on Asher to the FBI. Abe revealed that his best friend was the one who set the federal building on fire and also reportedly broke into the stock exchange office as well. Asher was confused over his friend's bizarre behavior and confronted him. Abe then began questioning Rose and Asher about their relationship. He found it hard to digest the fact that his wife had a fling with his best friend, he also questioned them on the timeline of their dating.</p><p>When Rose tried to reason with Abe by pointing out how it was over 30 years ago, and that he was the one who broke up with her which led to her brief fling with Asher. Unfortunately, Abe wasn't ready to listen to his wife's or his best friend's explanation and locked himself into his room. Asher stormed out as well, leaving Rose by herself. Will Abe be able to get over his wife's past?
