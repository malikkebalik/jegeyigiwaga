Now, almost a decade later, he is a model, actor, and singer.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Here is everything you need to know about Dallas — from his early life to his <a href=# rel=follow>net worth</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Dallas’s Childhood and Education&nbsp;</h2><p>Dallas was born on September 8, 1994, in Los Angeles. He was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">raised</a> in Chino by his single mother, Gina. Dallas has one older sister, Sierra.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>His father was out of the picture when Dallas was small. Gina worked as a sales rep to handle the family.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>They lived in a garage apartment, which was attached to a daycare. Each day when he returned home to do his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">homework</a>, all he could hear was children playing.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>During middle school, Dallas was introduced to social media. Since then, he has&nbsp;wanted to be someone famous on the internet. Unfortunately, this did not do well for his studies.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">internet persona</a> “barely graduated” from high school. However, he was already deep into being an internet personality. Hence, he did not know what he wanted to do.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Dallas did not attend college. Instead, he drove around the corner of the community college near his house to pretend that he attended the college.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He used to sleep in his car throughout the ‘classes’ and spend time on his phone. Later, he gave up being pretentious and fully committed to being a social media personality.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dallas’s Claim To Fame&nbsp;</h2><p>Dallas started posting videos on Vine in 2012. He used to post videos of him doing pranks on his family and friends. Soon enough, he was a viral sensation.&nbsp;</p><p>With good looks and humor, Dallas had a massive fan base. As of 2014, He became the 10th most <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">followed</a> Viner, overtaking Viners like Logan Paul and Lele Pons.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Along with his Vine, Dallas managed his other social media platforms. By then his YouTube channel started gaining traction.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Dallas was amongst the first influencers to get over a million likes on a post. He was also getting paid up to $20,000 for one sponsored post.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He used to go on tours with his friends and conduct meet-and-greets. He earned a lot of money from sponsors, movies, music, and his own Netflix show.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Dallas’s Battle With Addiction&nbsp;</h2><p>Dallas was very successful in social media to the point he was getting obsessed with it. He was closely tracking the numbers of likes and followers.&nbsp;</p><p>The social media star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confessed</a>&nbsp;social media was a drug for him. He used to feel high when he gained likes and followers. However, if they decreased, he would feel confused.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This took a massive toll on him. He started drinking a lot and spending most of his time at various clubs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">arrested</a> on felony vandalism charges. Similarly, on New Year’s Eve of 2018, he was arrested and charged with felony assault for punching a man in the face in Colorado.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Eventually, Dallas went to rehab to recover from "addiction, anxiety, depression and a bunch of other things." In May 2019, he celebrated a year of being sober.&nbsp;</p><p>Dallas has been heavily invested in self-care and self-work. He has avoided drinking and drugs completely. Similarly, he has been using social media carefully.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He removed everything from his Instagram before October 2018. Now, he is recovering well with full support from his family and girlfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Dallas — An Actor and A Singer&nbsp;</h2><p>Throughout his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">career</a>, Dallas has got massive opportunities. He has starred in two movies — Expelled and The Outfield with fellow Viner, Nash Grier.&nbsp;</p><p>He has also voiced Freddie in The Frog Kingdom and appeared in two episodes of Odyssey.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Dallas has starred in Charli XCX’s music video ‘Boys.’ He has also modeled for Dolce & Gabbana: Eyewear Campaign for Fall/Winter 2018 and 2019.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He starred as himself in his Netflix Original series Chasing Cameron. Recently, in January 2020, he portrayed Aaron Samuels in Mean Girls on Broadway.&nbsp;</p><p>Dallas also has a successful <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">singing</a> career. He debuted his first single, ‘She Bad’ in 2015. Since then, he has released seven singles.&nbsp;</p><p>On September 8, 2020, Dallas released his first studio album, Dear Scarlett. With all the projects the internet sensation is involved with, his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> is a whopping $4 million.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5iurrHRqKVmnJGhuaK%2FjJympaSVnLJvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-much-is-parking-at-fisherman-s-wharf-in-san-francisco.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Much is Parking at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco?</a>
