One of them is <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3733434?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Jemima Kirke</a>, best known for portraying Jessa Johansson in "Girls." <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3860305?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Lola Kirke</a>, on the other hand, appeared in "Gone Girl" and "Mozart in the Jungle."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/95296d9d80946a588c1822bf555332fe.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Domino Kirke and Penn Badgley on April 30, 2017 in New York City | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DOMINO KIRKE'S CAREER</strong></p><p class=dh>Unlike her sisters, Domino chose to follow in her dad's footsteps and became a musician. It is reported that she has been making music since her teenage years, but her debut album, "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7801341/domino-kirke-beyond-waves-new-single>Beyond Waves</a>," was released in 2017.</p><p class=dh>She is a talented rising star, and the fact that she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a30225238/penn-badgley-wife-domino-kirke/>has already collaborated</a> with world-famous producer Mark Ronson and toured with Lily Allen and Gang of Four proves it.</p><p class=dh>If that wasn't enough, Domino Kirke also works as a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/domino-kirke-solo-album-penn-badgley/>doula</a> – a person who assists families before, during, and after birth. It is fair to say that being a doula is her passion as she co-founded an agency called Carriage House.</p><p class=dh>The Brooklyn-based organization, established in 2012, expanded to Los Angeles only two years later, having actress and comedian <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a30857017/who-is-domino-kirke-penn-badgley-wife/>Amy Schumer</a> as one of its most famous clients.</p><p class=dh>Amy, who gave birth to a boy named Gene in May 2019, praised Domino and her doula agency in a now-deleted post on social media by pointing out that they made her and her husband, Chris Fisher, feel secure and supported during her pregnancy and birth process.</p><p class=dh>As per Domino's love life, she has been in two serious relationships throughout her life. Her first partner was fellow musician <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a30225238/penn-badgley-wife-domino-kirke/>Morgan O'Kane</a>, and although there are little-to-no details available about their time together, they share a son named Cassius Kirke, born in 2009.</p><p class=dh>Sadly, things didn't work out for the former couple, and they parted ways. After that, Domino started dating "You" actor <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com.au/celebrity/penn-badgley-domino-kirke-19660>Penn Badgley</a>, and they have been together ever since.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>I didn't think marriage was in the cards for us.</strong></h3><p class=dh><strong class=bh>PENN BADGLEY AND DOMINO KIRKE'S TWO WEDDINGS</strong></p><p class=dh>Unlike many other celebrities, Penn and Domino have done their best to keep their relationship away from the spotlight, which is why it is unclear when they first began dating.</p><p class=dh>They were first reported to be romantically involved, though, in 2014. Then, in February 2017, the couple tied the knot in front of a selected group of friends and family in a private courthouse ceremony in Brooklyn.</p><p class=dh>One ceremony was not enough for Penn and Domino, apparently, so they held a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vogue.com/article/penn-badgley-domino-kirke-wedding-details>bigger wedding</a> in June 2017. The event, which took place in upstate New York, had some famous guests, including <a class="me a" href=#>Mariska Hargitay</a> and Heidi Klum.</p><p class=dh>Domino once admitted that, before meeting Penn, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com.au/celebrity/penn-badgley-domino-kirke-19660>was not into actors</a> as she grew up with two actress sisters. The fact that Penn is also quite involved in music was probably crucial in their relationship.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DOMINO KIRKE DIDN'T THINK OF MARRIAGE, INITIALLY</strong></p><p class=dh>The singer once opened up how hers and Penn's relationship began, and she pointed out that it was not "nearly as serious as it is now." She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com.au/celebrity/penn-badgley-domino-kirke-19660>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I didn't think marriage was in the cards for us. So, I was sort of just chugging along, surviving, and getting through the days."</p><p class=dh>On October 5, Penn Badgley's wife <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CF-I0I3F30P/>took to Instagram</a> to share a photo of the family's new addition: a baby boy whose name has not been shared yet.
