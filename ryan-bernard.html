Bernard Funeral Services was founded by Ryan. He founded the company in 2017 and hopes that his family will carry on his legacy and pass it down to future generations. He is particularly confident that his daughters will inherit the family business from him.</p><p>Ryan converted an old bank building into a funeral and cremation home, keeping the “old traditional funeral stuff” but also adding new things. Ryan once stated, “I am 41 years old.” I’m not just trying to reach out to grandmothers and grandfathers; I’m also attempting to reach out to millennials and baby boomers.”</p><p>Concerning the television show Buried By The Bernards, Ryan and his family were cast on Netflix after their television commercial went viral in 2018. The Bernards first appeared on the Steve Harvey Show in 2017 for their headline-making drive-thru window viewings. The commercial depicted a dead body rising from a coffin to lament his own funeral expenses.</p><p>Events like this piqued the interest of a producer, and thus the show was born.</p><p>Ryan previously stated to WATN, a Memphis-based television station, that he and his family did not want to be a part of it at first. However, they changed their minds when the producers announced, “Hey, we’re going to make this into a comedy — your uncle Kevin and your mom.” We’re going to make a comedy out of this, and we’re going to focus on the family rather than the business.”</p><p>Ryan responded, “We thought that was a great idea, so we just went with it because this is what we do every day.”</p><p>You can now see for yourself how the Bernards have been assisting families in their grief while running their low-cost funeral home in the series, which was shot between 2019 and 2020, before the covid-19 pandemic.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Ryan_Bernard><span class="TextRun SCXW109584479 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW109584479 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Ryan Bernard?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW109584479 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p><strong>Ryan Bernard had a net worth of $400 thousand as of 2021.</strong></p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Ryan Bernard&nbsp;estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

Most media outlets have referred to his family as an “unconventional” family.</p><p>Some of Ryan’s fans must be wondering, “Who is his wife?” Let us clear things up for you.</p><p>Ryan is the father of two daughters, Deja, 25, and Raegan Bernard, 18. (ages as of Feb 2021). They have different mothers. Ryan did not appear to be romantically involved with any of his baby mamas at the time. It’s also unclear whether Deja or Raegan’s mothers were Ryan’s wives.</p><p>Ryan’s daughters spent a large portion of their childhoods apart. Ryan only found out about Deja’s existence after she turned 15 for two reasons: one, they are half-siblings, and two, Ryan only found out about Deja’s existence after she turned 15.</p><p>Raegan, a fourth-grader at the time, learned about Deja when her mother called to inform her that she had an older sister. The Bernard siblings, like Ryan, Debbie, and Kevin, are the show’s standout stars. They appeared to have developed an incredible bond over time.</p><p>Raegan also has an older brother, just so you know. We couldn’t tell for sure if he was also Ryan’s son.</p><p>Both sisters are shown making significant contributions to the funeral home. Deja even sees her two daughters inheriting the company one day.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kimber Walker- Wiki, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></h3>Kemba Walker is a professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks.
