He is the grandson of Jackie and Cecil Newton Sr., who was a safety for the Buffalo Bills and Dallas Cowboys in 1984 and 1983, respectively.</p><p>Cecil Newton, Camidas’ uncle and the younger brother of his father, was a center for the Jacksonville Jaguars. In the middle of the 2010s, Caylin, his other paternal uncle, played quarterback for Howard Bison.</p><p>Furthermore, his contented eyes and broad smile can be seen in the fourth and last picture. In the end, Kia posted a video of her son and herself using Snapchat filters to cap off the Instagram carousel. The NFL player’s ex-girlfriend incessantly called tiny Camidas a “momma’s boy” and claimed he resembled her.</p><h2><span id=Parents_of_Camidas_Swain_Newton>Parents of Camidas Swain Newton</span></h2><p>Kia, sometimes known as Erika Proctor, is Camidas’ mother. She is a model and former stripper from Maryland. Proctor used to work as Hazel at the Washington Stadium DC Club. The mother of Camidas currently describes herself as an Ig model. After relocating to Atlanta, she started working as a socialite and party host.</p><p>Proctor, the daughter of Anne Maria and Jerome Proctor, was born in Virginia on October 16, 1988.</p><p>In 2013, she began dating the quarterback for the New England Patriots at the time. In 2013, the two made their red carpet debut together at the Kentucky Derby. However, the announcement that Camidas Newton and his parents were dating came in 2014 at the NFL Honors.</p><h2><span id=The_father_of_Camidas_Swain_Newton_cheated_on_his_mother>The father of Camidas Swain Newton cheated on his mother.</span></h2><p>Blast revealed in January 2020 that Cameron had broken up with his long-term partner Kia Proctor after she gave birth to a child with Instagram model La Reina Shaw.</p><p>The publication went on to say that Swain’s father, Cam, had been seeing La Reina Shaw for a while and that the two had given birth to a son over the summer, named Caesar. According to reports, the NFL player’s eatery Fellaship was right above the Instagram model’s residence in Atlanta. They had been spotted together on New Year’s Eve by others. Shaw had furthermore shared a picture from Cam’s Atlanta restaurant. Jaden, her kid from her previous boyfriend, is her own child.</p><p>After Proctor’s infidelity was made public by the media in late 2019, Swain’s biological parents, Cameron and Proctor, split up.</p><h2><span id=The_Parents_of_Camidas_Swain_Newton_Warred_Over_His_Custody>The Parents of Camidas Swain Newton Warred Over His Custody</span></h2><p>In the early years of his existence, Camidas’s parents engaged in a tug-of-war in which he ended up as the prized prize. His baby mom Kia Proctor and father Cam fought in court over joint custody.</p><p>It’s said that Camidas never got to live with his father, the quarterback. For this reason, his father requested visitation, joint custody, and paternity. He even requested that the court assess the amount of child support that he must pay.</p><p>Conversely, Kia requested sole custody, child maintenance, and legal costs. Given that she was aware that Cam was receiving numerous endorsement deals in addition to a guaranteed $60 million salary, she requested child support that exceeded the requirements. Proctor also demanded $15,000 from the former player for the Carolina Panthers so that she could pay a forensic accountant to look into his financial records.</p><p>Camidas’ mother disclosed in the documents that she had been living apart from Cam for several months. She claimed that although Cam desired to remain in Atlanta, she had been preparing to return to her home state of Maryland.</p><h2><span id=Camidas_Swain_Newton_Is_Sibling_Number_Five>Camidas Swain Newton Is Sibling Number Five</span></h2><p>As previously stated, Cameron Jerrell Newton has other children besides Camidas Swain Newton. Three other siblings make up Swain’s family: Cashmere Newton (2019), Sovereign-Dior Cambella Newton (2017), and brothers Chosen Sebastian Newton (2015).</p><p>In addition, he has an older half-sister from his mother’s previous relationship named Shakira. Along with their father, Newton and his brother spend a lot of time together. Every now and then, the Newtons travel. As a result of his father’s present connection with Shaw, Swain is Caesar’s half-brother as well.</p><p>The father of Camidas does not want his son to resemble him.</p><p>Despite his affection for each and every one of his kids, Cam doesn’t want them to end up like him.</p><p>A heartfelt video letter was delivered in 2017 by the first draftee overall to Camidas’ brother, Chosen, stating, among other things,</p><p>“Son, don’t emulate me. Be superior to me. To be welcomed by me, you don’t need to be an athlete. Anything is possible for you to become. However you choose to proceed, I implore you to excel.</p><p>It goes without saying that the Georgian football player wants all of his children—including Camidas—to uphold the same values, even though he may not have expressed these ideas to each of them individually.</p><h2><span id=How_secure_is_Camidas_Swain_Newton8217s_financial_situation_with_each_of_his_parents>How secure is Camidas Swain Newton’s financial situation with each of his parents?</span></h2><p>If Cam and Kia, the ex-couple, are done for good or if there is still hope for a reunion, only time will tell. However, it appears like Swain will have two families moving forward: his mother, a social media celebrity, and his billionaire football player father. The three-year-old’s future and any care he may receive could be as warm as anyone could hope for, no matter who he ends up with. This much is almost certain.</p><p>With incentives, Newton’s father Cameron’s $1.05 million basic pay could be worth up to $7.5 million during his one-year contract with the Patriots. Not to add that he has a net worth of more than $70 million.</p><p>Although the financial status and net worth of Swain’s mother, Proctor, are unknown, it is quite likely that she could easily raise her children, including Camidas, on her own, meeting all of their demands and then some. Though she is thought to have founded several businesses, she has been clearly successful as a glamor consultant.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Concetta Monti, Chani Natasha, and Peachprc."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4224,"10":2,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":40}{"1":46,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":54}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/concetta-monti/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/chani-natasha/"}{"1":40}{"1":46,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/peachprc/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Concetta Monti</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Chani Natasha</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Peachprc</a>.</span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>celebrity child</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Where Is Lauren Scafidi Going After Leaving 9&10 News?
