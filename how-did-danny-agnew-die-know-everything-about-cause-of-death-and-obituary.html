What was the cause of his death?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On june 15, 2023, Danny Agnew lost his life due to a horrific car accident on Interstate 95. Reports indicate that eight cars were involved in the accident, which occurred at around 2:10 a.m.</p><p>While the details of the circumstances surrounding the accident are still unclear, what we do know is that Agnew was driving a Tesla that crashed into a concrete barrier before coming to a stop in the middle of the highway. Tragically, a Dodge sedan then collided with the Tesla, and the driver was ejected from the vehicle. A white Nissan was unable to avoid the accident and collided with a Chevrolet SUV, resulting in the Nissan running over Agnew. Despite several minor crashes involving other vehicles, it was Agnew who tragically lost his life from injuries sustained in the fatal crash. Investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the accident that ultimately led to Danny Agnew’s untimely passing.</p><p><strong>Posted below:</strong></p><p>Isaiah Thomas<br>We went from friends to business partners to brothers.
