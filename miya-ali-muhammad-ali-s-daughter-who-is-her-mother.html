Miya, a Notary Signing Agent, is also a single mother with one child. However, the identity of her child’s biological father remains a well guarded secret.</strong></p><p>Mia has seven half-siblings from her late father’s side, as well as one adoptive brother. Even after his death, the renowned boxer is still talked about, yet many people are unaware of Miya Ali’s mother.</p><p>So, in this essay, we’ll strive to learn a lot about her family history and professional accomplishments. Let’s get started!</p><h2><span id=Miya_Ali_how_old_are_you_Extramarital_Affair_Between_Her_Father_and_Her_Mother>Miya Ali, how old are you? Extramarital Affair Between Her Father and Her Mother</span></h2><p>Miya is fifty years old. She was born in the United States of America in December 1972.

However, Ali and Harvell split up not long after Mia was born. They never got married.</p><p>Her mother has kept her life out of the spotlight since her divorce from Ali, making it impossible to discuss her current situation. However, we have learned that Miya is quite close to her mother. She’s posted a few flashback images of her mother on social media. Ali captioned a childhood photo of herself and her mother, Pat, “TBT me and my mommy aka Pat” in February 2017.</p><h2><span id=Miya_Ali_was_first_unaware_of_her_father8217s_enormous_popularity>Miya Ali was first unaware of her father’s enormous popularity.</span></h2><p>Growing up as Muhammad Ali’s daughter, Miya had no concept how famous her father was.
