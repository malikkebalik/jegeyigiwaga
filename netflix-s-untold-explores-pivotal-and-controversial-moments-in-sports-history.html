There have been career-damaging controversies in sports that often get looked over.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But that is not the case anymore. Netflix, a haven for binge-worthy documentaries, is coming up with a new one titled&nbsp;Untold which will explore&nbsp;five sports controversies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The documentary will have&nbsp;five feature-length episodes, dedicating one episode to one story.</p><p>Two episodes of Untold are directed and produced by&nbsp;Chapman and MacLain Way, the brothers behind Wild West Country, while the other three will be done by&nbsp;Floyd Russ, Laura Brownson, and Crystal Moselle.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Volume one of Untold will premiere on August 10, 2021, on Netflix. A brief description of the five stories featured in Untold is as follows.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The Pacers–Pistons Brawl</h2><p>The&nbsp;Pacers–Pistons brawl, commonly known as&nbsp;Malice at the Palace, is an infamous fight between two National Basketball Association (NBA) Teams, Indiana&nbsp;Pacers and&nbsp;Detroit Pistons. The fight was so bad that it <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was&nbsp;dubbed</a>&nbsp;"the most infamous brawl in NBA history." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It all started when there were only 45.9 seconds left in the game.&nbsp;Pistons center Ben Wallace tried a layup shot but was fouled from behind by Pacers' small forward Ron Artest, giving the Pacers a 97–82 advantage.</p><p>Wallace became enraged and shoved Artest, resulting in a brawl on the court between players from both sides. After the fight was broken up, a spectator in the stands tossed a drink at Artest, who was cooling himself down on the scorer's table. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Still agitated from the brawl, Artest went for the&nbsp;fan right away, igniting a big scuffle involving players and fans that lasted several minutes and spread from the stands down to the court. The game was then called off by the referees without the remaining time being played.</p><h2>Caitlyn Jenner</h2><p>Before <a href=# rel=follow>Caitlyn Jenner</a> became an American socialite and a businesswoman, she used to be an Olympian. This was before her gender transition when she used to go by the name Bruce Jenner with the pronouns he/him.&nbsp;</p><p>Jenner was an outstanding athlete who broke many records and won a lot of accolades.&nbsp;At 26, she became an American hero when she won a decathlon gold medal at the&nbsp;1976 Montreal Olympics.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>While the nation was cheering for her, she was not happy. She knew <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she had&nbsp;gender dysphoria</a>, and at that time, it was taking a toll on her. She eventually retired from the life of sports.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jenner began therapy in the 1980s, intending to transition before turning 40, but she ultimately concluded she couldn't do it. Instead, she met Kris Kardashian and became the stepfather to the Kardashian sisters, Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe.</p><p>Kylie and <a href=# rel=follow>Kendall Jenner</a> are his biological daughters with Kris.&nbsp;After the marriage fell apart, Jenner contemplated transitioning once more and eventually succeeded in 2015.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Christy Martin</h2><p>Christy Martin is arguably one of the strongest women in the history of the sports industry.&nbsp;She is the CEO of Christy Martin Promotions and a former American world champion boxer.</p><p>She began her career in 1989 as a fighter in "Toughwoman" competitions, where she won three titles in a row. She subsequently began training with James&nbsp;Martin, a boxing coach who would later become her husband in 1991.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On November 23, 2010, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Christy was stabbed</a> many times and shot at least once in the torso by her husband. He left her for dead, but the boxer was a survivor, and nothing would stop her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She escaped James and dragged herself to the road, and stopped a car. She begged the driver to let her live, and he called 911 to help Christy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The incident happened after an altercation in their Apopka home. After stabbing himself on November 30, 2010, James&nbsp;was apprehended and transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Episode 623 features Christy Martin, a former World Champion Boxer and now a CEO. Christy is a victim of violent domestic abuse and in this episode we learn what she went through, how she recovered, and how she made something good out of it. Listen to Christy on episode 623! <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/UrG116MyWL</a> — Joel Goldberg (@goldbergkc) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">July 27, 2021</a></p><p>He was arrested and charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon at the Orange County Jail. Christy recovered and fought two games until she retired two years later, in 2012.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Danbury Trashers</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">story of&nbsp;The Danbury Trashers</a> is a unique one.&nbsp;They began in 2004 as an expansion team named after their owner's James Galante's business endeavors. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>For $500,000, Galante, a convicted felon and mobster,&nbsp;bought the franchise rights and designated his 17-year-old son A. J. as president and general manager.</p><p>A.J. was a senior at New Fairfield High School at the time, and he was the alternate captain of his school's hockey team. Unfortunately, he had a severe knee injury and was unable to continue playing hockey.</p><p>Galante intended to do everything he could to re-establish his son's happiness. As a result, he purchased A.J. an ice hockey team. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The hockey team did quite well, and Galante made his players happy by giving them all the resources he could. But the happiness lasted only two&nbsp;years.</p><p>In 2006, Galante was charged with a whopping 72 different charges spread across multiple crimes. And as a result, The Danbury Trashers were disbanded forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Mardy Fish&nbsp;</h2><p>Mardy Fish was one of the best male&nbsp;tennis players of his time in the United States. He was ranked in the top ten, won an Olympic silver medal,&nbsp;and many accolades. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fish gave up everything after reaching the height of his career. However, he did it for a good reason - he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">prioritized mental health</a> over tennis.&nbsp;</p><p>He had a frightening cardiac arrhythmia in 2012, which resulted in panic and anxiety episodes. He thought he was going to die since his heart was racing so rapidly.</p><p>Fish found it difficult to play tennis since then. He was terrified, unable to concentrate, and he couldn't bring himself to play the sport he previously excelled at.</p><p>Eventually, he retired after the&nbsp;2015 US Open, saying goodbye to his successful career as a tennis player forever.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKaVqbOttddmrKesn6Gxbq%2FAoqulsZ5it6a6zZ6pZpuYp7a0wNhmpJqqpJ67brnAq5uyZZaewKl6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./shy-glizzy-height-how-tall-is-shy-glizzy.html>&#171;&nbsp;Shy Glizzy Height How Tall is Shy Glizzy?</a>
