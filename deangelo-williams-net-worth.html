Little by little he progressed, and in his junior season, DeAngelo had 1,044 rushing yards, with 14 touchdowns, which earned him All-American honors. He led his team to the state 4A championship in his senior season, in which he had an outstanding 2,204 rushing yards, and 34 touchdowns.

He set several records, including the NCAA record for most 100-yard rushing games with 34. Also he was selected in the First-team All-American and received the ARA Sportsmanship Award.</p><p>After his graduation, DeAngelo entered the 2006 NFL Draft, in which he was selected by the Carolina Panthers.
