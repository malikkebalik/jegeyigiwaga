id=content-paragraph-2>“Linda.” That was all that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sarah Paulson </strong></a>captioned her Nov. 13 Instagram post, giving fans a first glimpse of her as <strong>Linda Tripp.</strong> Whoever did Sarah’s makeup just won&nbsp;all&nbsp;the awards, because the 45-year-old actress was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>unrecognizable</a>. Actually, she&nbsp;was&nbsp;recognizable — as Linda Tripp! Sarah was the spitting image of the White House and Pentagon employee whose secret recordings of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Monica Lewinsky</strong></a>&nbsp;led to the impeachment of President <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Sarah also told her followers that principle photography on <strong>Ryan Murphy</strong>’s American Crime Story: Impeachment has begun shooting. The third season of American Crime Story was supposed to begin filming in the spring but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sarah-paulson-makeover-ap-images-linda-tripp-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sarah, who won a Golden Globe for portraying <strong>Marcia Clark </strong>in the first American Crime Story, spoke in June about the intense makeup job that would require her to accurately portray Linda. “This is going to require a lot of things,” she said on an episode of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>, adding that she would be “earing a lot of prosthetics and body transformational accouterments, if that’s a word I can use.” Sadly, Linda will not be able to see Sarah’s work. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>She passed away in April</a> at age 70 after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Sarah said she didn’t get a chance to meet Linda before her death – and she didn’t meet Marcia, 67, until she was finished with The People V. O.J. Simpson.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I don’t know if I ever would have met Linda,” Sarah told <strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong>, “or if Linda would have even been open to doing anything like that. But I got as many text messages when she passed away as if I had died or if she was my best friend. People were like, ‘I’m so sorry to hear about Linda’ and I was like, ‘I’m really sorry to hear about it too, but I didn’t know her.’ And it was weird, because I had been spending so much time reading all these books and working with a dialect coach, so I was immersed in this. It was a very wild thing and it really did make me sad.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sarah-paulson-makeover-ap-images-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>The actual Linda Tripp was a career civil servant. After working two decades as a secretary for the military, Linda landed a position working within the White House in 1990, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Washington Post</a>. After Bill Clinton defeated <strong>George H. W. Bush</strong>, Linda stated in the White House for two years until she transferred to the Pentagon’s public affairs house. Her literary aspirations – she wanted to write a book about working as a secretary for two presidents – would lead to Clinton’s impeachment. In 1996, Linda met Monica, a former White House intern who was in the midst of a two-year affair with the president. The two became close, and Monica began to share details about her tortured affair with a married man.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Linda shared this info with her literary agent, a conservative critic named <strong>Lucianne Goldberg</strong>, who urged his client to record her conversations. She recorded 22 hours of Monica’s confessions, and in January 1998, she handed them over to independent counsel <strong>Ken Starr</strong>. Clinton was impeached for lying under oath and for obstruction of justice but was acquitted by the Senate. Linda was eviscerated in the press, portrayed as a duplicitous woman who betrayed her friend (though Linda has always argued she wasn’t motivated by politics, but by morality.) She was fired on her last day of Clinton’s presidency (as a political appointee, she refused to resign) and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>relocated to Virginia</a> to run a holiday store.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In America Crime Story: Impeachment, Booksmart’s <strong>Beanine Feldstein </strong>will portray Monica Lewinski, while <strong>Clive Owen </strong>will play Bill Clinton. The actual Monica is working with the series as an executive producer, and Ryan Murphy said that Impeachment will give Monica a long-overdue redemption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I’m very, very excited to have Monica Lewinsky’s version of what happened to be put out there in the world,” Ryan said, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Collider</a>, “and I think that she’s earned the right to be able to tell her story, how she wants to tell it. And I think her version of what happened and the facts will be very startling to people, and I think it’s important. I love and care for her as a person.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ye5BsZqyZopa1brzArqOsp55iuaq6w5pkraqZpb1uuM6oopqkmaCybq3Mnqmim5GjeqS%2ByKacZqukpL%2B6ecimp56Zk526prrTZqeim6Nk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-stage-chords-by-avenged-sevenfold.html>&#171;&nbsp;THE STAGE CHORDS by Avenged Sevenfold</a>
