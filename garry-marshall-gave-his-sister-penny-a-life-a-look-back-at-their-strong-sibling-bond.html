Since he was older than her, he reached a celebrity status before.</p><p class=dh>Fortunately, Penny was always a talented actress, and Garry knew it. For that reason, while he was working in "The Odd Couple," he brought his sister to play Myrna for two years, between 1972 and 1974. From that point on, her career skyrocketed.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>PENNY MARSHALL ON HOW HER BROTHER GAVE HER A LIFE</strong></p><p class=dh>Apart from working in "Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers," "Mary Tyler Moore," and "Happy Days," Penny starred in "Laverne & Shirley," which is one of her most memorable roles even nowadays.

It's not many people who have a brother who give them a life. He gave me a life, and I appreciate it, and I tried to not let him down."</p><p class=dh>One of the main reasons for Penny to credit her brother for how her life turned out to be in such a way is that, before "The Odd Couple," she had been told that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/penny-marshall-sitcom-star-who-directed-league-of-their-own-dies-at-75/2018/12/18/d81ed3ac-02f5-11e9-9122-82e98f91ee6f_story.html?utm_term=.59a2e172bb91">she was "unattractive."</a></p><p class=dh>Garry always supported her and made sure that she knew that show producers just couldn't understand her yet.

Garry even admitted that it was the "toughest show" he ever did because the main star was his sister.</p><p class=dh>The producer and director confessed that Penny had plenty of ideas to improve the series, and while some of them indeed made it better, they also led to some creative differences between them.</p><p class=dh>Garry Marshall is known for making happy the people who worked with him. However, he "couldn't seem" to make his own sister happy while working together.
