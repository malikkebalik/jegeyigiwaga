You are endlessly curious, an avid explorer, and a voracious inspector. You are constantly absorbing, processing, and hypothesizing. You are always seeking a new adventure. You are always challenging what you thought was possible. You prefer to do things yourself. If possible, you prefer to do two things at once. I don't think you've met a food that you haven't liked. You are highly driven, and (gulp) strong-willed. You are SO STRONG, and fast as lightning. And yet, you are so gentle and tender. You deeply love nature, fresh air, and all living things. Above all else, being outside is your favorite. There is no crankiness or booboo that playing in some grass can't fix. Your awe and fascination with God's creation is inspiring, and I'm so curious to see how that develops as you get older. You are utterly fearless and courageous. Nothing seems to phase you. You are kind, generous, and so incredibly social. Even on your not-so-great days, you brighten the lives of everyone you come across. Your smile is disarming, and contagious. You are absolutely gorgeous, which terrifies me. Good or bad, you feel everything with an alarming intensity. You can be challenging, and you can be confusing, but even in the midst of the chaos of life, you still manage to be the sweetest little hunk of love that anyone could ever imagine. Mommy and Daddy lucked out when God decided that we got to have you in our lives. We have many years ahead of us, but I do wish we could stop right here for a while. You're getting so big, so fast, and I wish there were more hours in the day to enjoy being with you, and to watch you take in the world around you. As you head into your second year, may you continue to grow in the special qualities that you've been given– and as you pass more and more milestones on the way to full-blown childhood, may you never lose that wonder that sparks in your beautiful blue eyes every day. You are loved by so many, and I hope you know that will never change. Happy First Birthday, my dearest daughter ❤</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Nathan Kress</a> (@nathankress) on Dec 21, 2018 at 12:53pm PST</p><p>Above all, we wish Nathan all the luck for his fatherhood.
